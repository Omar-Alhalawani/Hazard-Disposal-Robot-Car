# Hazard Disposal Robot Car ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

A wireless Arduino-based robot car with a mounted robotic arm, designed to safely handle and transport hazardous objects.  
Built as part of the TEJ4M Computer Engineering summative project.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Arduino Uno & ESP8266 (WiFi control)
- C++ (Arduino IDE)
- Blynk IoT App (mobile control)
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- Servo Motors (HS-322HD for steering + robotic arm)
- AutoCAD & Woodworking (mount design)
- Parallel 7.2V batteries for higher current output

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Wireless control of the car via **ESP8266 + Blynk app**
- Custom-built **robotic arm** for object pickup and transport
- **Separate Arduino Uno + potentiometer controller** for arm movement
- Wooden mounts and modified RC car chassis
- Designed to simulate **hazard disposal by law enforcement**

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Upload `src/car_control.ino` to the ESP8266 board.  
   - Connect via the **Blynk IoT app** on your smartphone.  
2. Upload `src/arm_control.ino` to an Arduino Uno.  
   - Connect potentiometers to control the arm manually.  
3. Power with dual 7.2V batteries in parallel for stable operation.
